## IMGUI with Fyne - Go Library for Immediate Mode GUI

This library implements an *Immediate Mode GUI* (IMGUI) using the Fyne framework for Go. IMGUI is a user interface paradigm where GUI elements are drawn and updated every frame, eliminating the need for defining a static widget tree. This approach simplifies the development of dynamic, responsive interfaces, making it ideal for applications that require high interactivity and a fast workflow.

### Key Features:
- **Simplicity and Speed**: The IMGUI approach reduces the complexity of widget management and offers a more direct and faster workflow.
- **Built on Fyne**: Leverages the Fyne library for graphical rendering, taking advantage of its cross-platform capabilities (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- **Fully Customizable**: Enables the creation of highly customizable user interfaces, perfect for applications that need fine control over the GUI.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for smooth performance, even with complex and interaction-heavy applications.
